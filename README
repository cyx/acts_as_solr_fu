ActsAsSolrFu
============

This is basically meant to add a PaginatedCollectionProxy for solr results.

Example
=======

Basic usage looks like this:

Article.paginate_by_solr "Presidental Candidates", :facets => { ... },
  :per_page => 10, :page => 1

All of the options passed in paginate_by_solr are just passed through to 
find_by_solr with the exception of per_page and page.
